Performance Testing Report

Test Scenario

We are measuring the time taken to receive an output when hitting a URL with a query parameter.

Test Details

Test Type: Response Time Measurement

URL: [Endpoint being tested]

Query Parameters: [Describe parameters]

Method: GET/POST

Number of Requests: 1


Results

Response Time: 1.8 seconds


Observations

The response time is within/above the acceptable limit (define expected threshold).

Possible optimizations include query optimization, caching, and load balancing.


Next Steps

Conduct multiple requests to analyze consistency.

Identify potential bottlenecks (database, network latency, or server performance).

Optimize the backend processing if required.
